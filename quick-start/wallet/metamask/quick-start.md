# Connecting Your Wallet

## Install a Web3 Compatible Wallet

We recommend using the OKX Wallet (Mobile or Browser Extension) or Metamask for full featured web3 compatibility.
OKTC is also supported in TokenPocket, Bitkeep, ONTO and HyperPay. For details, check the tutorials of each wallet's official website.

## Creating a Wallet with Metamask

1. Click on the MetaMask icon in the upper right corner to open the extension.

2. To install the latest version of MetaMask, click “**Try It Now**”.

3. Click "**Continue**".

5. Proceed by clicking "**Next**",  then accept the "**Terms of Use**".

6. Click "**Reveal secret words**".

7. You will see a 12 word seed phrase. Your seed words are an encoding of your private key, NEVER give your seed words to anyone. (Not your keys, not your coins.)

8. Reveal the secret seed phrase and securely back them up either in writing, on steel, or using a hardware wallet like Ledger.
