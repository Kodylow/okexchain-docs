# Introduction

## What is OKTC？

### About OKT Chain
A Super Scalable, Compatible L1 Blockchain OKT Chain (OKTC) is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximized performance. At high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKT Chain ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.

### Advantages of OKT Chain
- High Scalability & Maximized Performance: Based on enhanced Tendermint and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus that can support up to 5000 Transactions per Second (TPS), Web3 applications shall reach their full potential at extremely low cost.
- Enhanced Interoperability: OKT Chain supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)nprotocol that — together with the Tendermint consensus algorithm, featuring instant finality — can be used to realize value transmission between Cosmos ecosystem within seconds. Being fully EVM compatible, OKT Chain allows developers to build projects without any learning cost.
- Developer Friendly: OKT Chain is completely open-source. Anyone can read it, check the progress, comment on it, and help build the ecosystem. OKT Chain also provides native oracle protocol and industry-leader Chainlink for maximum flexibility to access price feeds.
- Secure: The OKT Chain team offers a reliable smart contract auditing service, making it a genuinely decentralized protocol that avoids the centralization risks of most blockchain networks today.

## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute to the security and governance of the OKTC. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 100 validators on the OKTC blockchain to earn more OKT through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of the OKTC through on-chain governance proposals.

## OKTC CLI

`exchaincli` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the OKTC. `exchaincli` is the only tool that supports 100% of the OKTC features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about exchaincli with the [delegator's CLI guide](./delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html).


## Running a full-node on the OKTC Testnet

In order to run a full-node on the OKTC testnet, you must first [install `exchaind`](./getting-start/install-oktc.html). Then, follow [the guide](./getting-start/install-oktc.html).

If you would like to run a validator node, follow the [validator setup guide](./validators/validators-guide-cli.html).
